<h3>Query API: General Syntax Notes</h3>

<p>The Open Context API returns URLs with some descriptive information on how to query and filter. URLs in the <samp>id</samp> key and <samp>json</samp> keys represent requests for differnent filters in HTML (unless one requested otherwise with HTTP content negotiation) and JSON.</p>

<p>To make it easier to debug and understand, Open Context uses "slugs" to identify different predicates (descriptive properties and linking relations) and objects (mainly controlled vocabulary concepts) in a query. The <samp>slug</samp> keys in the Item Record and the Query JSON-LD APIs provide slugs that you can use in a query.</p>

<p>In the Open Context search API, the main pattern to composing queries works as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>A descriptive property predicate by itself filters for all records that have that descriptive property. In the example below, the search returns all records described by the predicate "Has biological taxonomy" (with that predicate identified by a slug):</p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records that have taxonomy descriptions" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy">prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy</a></samp></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Instead of using slugs you can also use URL-escaped URIs to identify concepts to use in a query. The query API provides URIs that identify concepts with the <samp>rdfs:isDefinedBy</samp> key (<em>Caveat: concepts in the oc-api and oc-gen namespaces won't resolve yet, so don't reference them in this way for the time being</em>). Here is the same query as above using a URI rather than a slug to identify the predicate "Has biological taxonomy". </p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records that have taxonomy descriptions" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2FNET%2Fbiol%2Fns%23term_hasTaxonomy">prop=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2FNET%2Fbiol%2Fns%23term_hasTaxonomy</a></samp></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To search for a specific value used with a given descriptive property, append a <samp>---</samp> delimiter after the slug for the descriptive property and follow with the slug (or URI) identifier for that value. In the example below, the search returns all records described by the predicate "Has biological taxonomy" and values identified with <samp>eol-p-1642</samp> for "Mammalia":</p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records described as Mammals" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1642">prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1642</a></samp></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>In the example above, Open Context has the object value <samp>eol-p-1642</samp> for "Mammalia" in a hierarchy of classifications. It automatically returns results that include mammals and all subordinate (more specific) taxa. You can further restrict the scope of your query to more specific taxa by appending a <samp>---</samp> delimiter after the <samp>eol-p-1642</samp> and then adding a slug for a more specific type of mammal. In the example below, the search returns all records described by the predicate "Has biological taxonomy" and values identified with <samp>eol-p-1642</samp> for "Mammalia" and "Carivora" (<samp>eol-p-7662</samp>):</p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records described as Mammals, Carnivores" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1642---eol-p-7662">prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1642---eol-p-7662</a></samp></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You don't need to know the position of a concept in a hierarchy in order to search for it. The following query returns identical results for Carnivores as the one above, but omits reference to Mammalia:</p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records described as Mammals, Carnivores" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-7662">prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-7662</a></samp></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Open Context uses double pipe characters ("<samp>||</samp>") for Boolean "OR" terms. The following example returns results described as either carnivore <samp>eol-p-7662</samp> or lagomorph (rabbits, hares) <samp>eol-p-7662</samp>:</p>
        <p><samp><a title="Query for records described as Mammals, Carnivores" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1686||eol-p-7662">prop=biol-term-hastaxonomy---eol-p-1686||eol-p-7662</a></samp></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Specialized Queries</h4>
<p>In addition to the general querying patterns discussed above, Open Context has some more specialized query options, as described below:</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <th class="col-sm-3">Parameter</th>
        <th class="col-sm-9">Definition and Examples</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <samp>q={URL encoded search term}</samp>
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>Adding this query parameter with a URL encoded search term requests a full-text search. This works similarly to familiar text searches elsewhere on the Web, and can be combined
                with other search parameters. Here is an example text search for the term "<a href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?q=bucchero" title="Request a full-text search for the term 'bucchero'">bucchero</a>".</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <samp>obj={URL encoded URI}</samp>
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>Adding this query parameter with a URL encoded URI requests records that link (via any attribute or relation predicate) to a URI-indentified entity defined by a data source, vocabulary or ontology outside of Open Context.</p>
                <p>For example, this search, <a href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?obj=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUBERON_0000979" target="_blank" title="Find records related to UBERON tibia">{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?obj=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUBERON_0000979</a>, finds all records associated with the UBERON concept for the bone element tibia, identified by this URI: <a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000979" target="_blank" title="UBERON tibia concept">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000979</a>. This example works similarly to a SPARQL query formulated like:</p>
                <samp>
                    SELECT ?s <br/>
                    { <br/>
                    ?s ?p &lt;http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000979&gt; <br/>
                    } <br/>
                </samp>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <samp>disc-bbox</samp>
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>This query parameter requests a filter defined by a geospatial bounding box for the location of discovery or description. The bounding box is expressed as comma sperated values of coordinates using the WGS84 (typical for Web mapping) decimal degrees. The order of coordinates follows the GeoJSON pattern of (x,y) (Longitude, Latitude). The first pair of coordinates defines the lower-left (south-west) corner of the bounding box, with the second pair of coordinates defines the top-right (north-east) corner. An invalid bounding box will be ignored as a search filter but will return a notice in the <samp>oc-api:active-filters</samp> of the JSON-LD response.</p>
                <p>Bounding Box search examples include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Filtering for a region in the south-east of the United States: <samp><a title="Search a bounding box" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?geodeep=11&disc-bbox=-87.19%2C21.29%2C-73.48%2C34.60">-87.19 Longitude, 21.29 Latitude (south-west corner) to -73.48 Longitude, 34.60 Latidude (north-east corner)</a></samp>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use the double pipe characters ("<samp>||</samp>") for Boolean "OR" searches of multiple regions, as in this example: <samp><a title="Search multiple bounding boxes" target="_blank" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/?geodeep=12&disc-bbox=31.37%2C34.31%2C35.42%2C35.96||31.86%2C35.89%2C34.53%2C36.97">31.37,C34.31,35.42,C35.96 (roughly Cyprus) OR 31.86,35.89,34.53,36.97 (roughly Cilicia in Turkey)</a></samp>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <samp>linked=dinaa-cross-ref</samp>
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>Adding this query parameter and value adds a special filter for interacting with data in the Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) project. The query filters for DINAA records cross-referenced with URI identified resources curated by other online collections. <a href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/United+States?proj=52-digital-index-of-north-american-archaeology-dinaa&linked=dinaa-cross-ref" title="Filter for DINAA records cross-referenced with Linked Data">Click here</a> to view cross-referenced records in DINAA.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
