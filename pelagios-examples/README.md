Open Context Pelagios Support

This directory contains sample outputs from Open Context to express how Open Context data
relates to place entities in Web gazetteers using the "recipes" promoted by the Pelagios
project (https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Joining-Pelagios).

Currently, this directory only includes test outputs of open annoation assertions expressed in the Turtle format. We will shortly also provide the needed VOID file to comply with Pelagios requirements.

In addition, some Open Context data can be used as gazetteer data, especially site file records published
with the Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) project. We will consult with the Pelagios
team to make sure these data meet Pelagios requirements for gazetteers.
